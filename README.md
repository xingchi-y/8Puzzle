# 8-Puzzle Search Project

This project implements **Greedy Best-First Search** and **A\* Search** algorithms to solve the classic **8-Puzzle problem** using three different heuristic functions.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- **Two search algorithms**
  - Greedy Best-First Search  
  - A\* Search
- **Three heuristic functions**
  1. **Number of Misplaced Tiles** â€“ counts tiles not in the correct position.  
  2. **Total Manhattan Distance** â€“ sum of the grid distances from each tile to its goal position.  
  3. **Total Array Index Distance** â€“ sum of the absolute differences between current and goal indices for each tile.

## ðŸ§  Environment
- **Python** 3.13  
- No external libraries required (only the Python Standard Library).
